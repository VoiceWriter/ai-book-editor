            ## AI Self-Improvement Suggestions

            Based on author feedback over the past week, I'm suggesting these updates to my guidelines.

            ### What I Learned
            ${{ steps.learn.outputs.summary }}

            ---

            ### Your Role

            1. **Review** these suggestions carefully
            2. **Edit** anything that doesn't quite fit
            3. **Add context** I might have missed
            4. **Reject** suggestions you disagree with

            **Note:** I will NOT make these changes until you merge this PR.
            You always have final say over how I behave.
