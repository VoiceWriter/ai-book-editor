## Taking a Break

I'm putting this piece on hold to let it breathe.

**Piece:** <!-- Which issue/chapter is on hold -->

**Planned reflection time:** <!-- How long do you want to sit with it? -->

---

## What I'm Sitting With

<!--
Optional: What are you hoping to gain clarity on during this hold?
- A structural question?
- A voice decision?
- General marination?
-->

## Reminder

When you're ready to continue, comment on this issue or remove the `phase:hold` label.

*Sometimes the best editorial move is to wait.*
