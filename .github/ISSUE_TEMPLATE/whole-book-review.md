## Request Whole Book Analysis

I'd like a comprehensive analysis of the complete manuscript, including:

- [ ] **Thematic Threads** - What themes run through the book?
- [ ] **Consistency Check** - Any contradictions across chapters?
- [ ] **Repetition Detection** - Content that's repeated?
- [ ] **Promise/Payoff Tracking** - What setups pay off? What's dangling?
- [ ] **Structural Assessment** - Does the chapter order make sense?

## Discovery Questions

Before diving in, my editor may ask:

1. What's the arc of your book in three sentences?
2. Which chapters feel strongest? Which feel wobbly?
3. What promise do you make in chapter one?

<!-- Feel free to answer these proactively, or wait for your editor to ask -->
