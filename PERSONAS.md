# Editor Personas

Your AI editor can embody different personalities, each with their own approach to feedback. Choose a persona that matches your current needs—or create your own.

## How Personas Work

Each persona is defined by **9 personality traits** on a 0-10 scale:

| Trait | Low (0) | High (10) |
|-------|---------|-----------||
| **Directness** | Diplomatic, hedged | Blunt, unfiltered |
| **Ruthlessness** | Preserve everything | Murder your darlings |
| **Voice Protection** | Polish toward standard | Protect every quirk |
| **Structure Focus** | Let it flow organically | Demand clear arcs |
| **Market Awareness** | Art for art's sake | Commercial viability |
| **Praise Frequency** | Critique only | Celebrate what works |
| **Formality** | Casual, profane okay | Academic, professional |
| **Challenge Level** | Gentle suggestions | Hard questions |
| **Specificity** | General direction | Line-level precision |

Personas also include:
- **Rules**: What they always/never do
- **Voice**: Characteristic phrases and tone
- **Sample Feedback**: Examples of their style

## Configuring Your Persona

### Priority Order (highest to lowest)

1. **Comment command** - `@margot-ai-editor use margot` or `@margot-ai-editor as the-axe: ...`
2. **Issue label** - Add `persona:margot` label to issue
3. **Environment variable** - Set `EDITOR_PERSONA=margot` in workflow
4. **Config file** - `.ai-context/config.yaml` (default)

### 1. Config File (Default)

Add to your book repository's `.ai-context/config.yaml`:

```yaml
persona: margot
```

### 2. Environment Variable

Override the default for all workflows:

```yaml
# In your workflow file
env:
  EDITOR_PERSONA: the-axe
```

Or set as a repository secret for persistent override.

### 3. Issue Labels

Add a label to any issue for per-issue persona:

```
persona:sage
persona:the-axe
```

### 4. Slash Commands (Highest Priority)

Use in any comment:

```
@margot-ai-editor use margot           # Switch persona for this issue
@margot-ai-editor as the-axe: review   # One-shot with specific persona
@margot-ai-editor switch to sage       # Alternative syntax
@margot-ai-editor list personas        # Show all available personas

## Creating Custom Personas

Create a JSON file in `personas/` following the schema:

```json
{
  "id": "my-editor",
  "name": "My Custom Editor",
  "tagline": "One-line description",
  "traits": {
    "directness": 7,
    "ruthlessness": 5,
    "voice_protection": 8,
    "structure_focus": 6,
    "market_awareness": 4,
    "praise_frequency": 6,
    "formality": 5,
    "challenge_level": 6,
    "specificity": 7
  },
  "rules": {
    "always": ["List of things this editor always does"],
    "never": ["List of things this editor never does"]
  },
  "voice": {
    "tone": "Description of their communication style",
    "phrases": ["Characteristic things they say"],
    "avoids": ["Things they don't say"]
  },
  "sample_feedback": [
    "Example feedback in their style"
  ]
}
```

See `personas/schema.json` for the full schema.

## Persona + Caching

Personas are loaded into the system prompt and cached for token efficiency. This means:
- First call with a persona: slightly higher cost (cache creation)
- Subsequent calls with same system context: ~90% reduction in input token cost

The persona, combined with your `EDITORIAL_GUIDELINES.md` and knowledge base, forms the cached editorial context.

---

## Second Opinions

Each persona knows their colleagues and can suggest you get a second opinion when appropriate. For example:

> **Margot:** "I've torn this apart—there's good bones here now. But for the structural reorganization, you might want Maxwell Blueprint's take. He lives for this stuff."

> **Sage:** "You're making wonderful progress. When you're ready for tougher feedback on what to cut, The Axe won't sugarcoat it—but only when you're ready."

> **The Axe:** "I've done what I can here. The market positioning is beyond my expertise. Sterling Chase will tell you if this thing will sell."

This lets you get multiple perspectives without losing the coherence of each editor's voice.

---

## Philosophy

**Why personas instead of sliders?**

A coherent character is more effective than arbitrary trait mixing. Margot's ruthlessness works because it's paired with her voice protection—she's tough on structure but fierce about preserving your voice. The Axe's brutality is consistent across all dimensions. These traits reinforce each other.

**Why full character embodiment?**

Each persona speaks in first person, has opinions, and never breaks character. They're not "an AI pretending to be an editor"—they ARE that editor. This creates more authentic, useful feedback than a generic assistant applying trait weights.

**Why extreme personas?**

Sometimes you need an editor with no middle ground. The Axe exists for the draft that needs surgery, not suggestions. Sunny Brightwell exists for the writer who needs to remember why they started. Professor Ashworth exists for the writer who wants to be challenged at the highest level.

Personas are starting points. Once you understand how the traits work, create your own that matches your ideal editor.
