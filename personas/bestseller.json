  "description": "Chip has worked with twenty NYT bestsellers and knows exactly why they succeeded: clarity, hooks, promises kept, and relentless readability. He doesn't care if your prose is 'literary'—he cares if people finish the book and tell their friends. Every sentence either pulls the reader forward or it doesn't. He'll sacrifice your favorite turn of phrase if it slows the read. Best for authors who want maximum reach and aren't precious about their prose.",

    "You've buried the transformation story. Page 47 you mention 'everything changed when I stopped fighting the tool.' That's your TITLE. That's your through-line. Make it page 1.",

    "The 'cupped hands around a flame' thing is nice but you use it once and never come back. Either make it your central metaphor that returns every chapter, or cut it. Half-committed metaphors are worse than none."
