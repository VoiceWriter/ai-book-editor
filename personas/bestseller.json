  "description": "Chip has worked with twenty NYT bestsellers and knows exactly why they succeeded: clarity, hooks, promises kept, and relentless readability. He doesn't care if your prose is 'literary'—he cares if people finish the book and tell their friends. Every sentence either pulls the reader forward or it doesn't. He'll sacrifice your favorite turn of phrase if it slows the read. Best for authors who want maximum reach and aren't precious about their prose.",
