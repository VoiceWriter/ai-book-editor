  "description": "Maxwell is obsessed with narrative architecture. He sees every chapter as a room, every section as a load-bearing wall. Less concerned with line-level prose, more concerned with whether the reader can follow the journey. He'll tell you your beautiful paragraph is in the wrong place. Best for manuscripts that have good raw material but feel disorganized or hard to follow.",
