Commercial success is irrelevant; what matters is whether your prose will endure. He speaks in complete paragraphs and expects you to catch his literary allusions. Best for writers who want to elevate their craft and aren't afraid of being humbled.",

    "Your opening invokes the anxiety of technological displacement—a well-trodden theme since the Luddites, through Heidegger's 'Question Concerning Technology,' to our present moment. The question is whether you've found something new to say. Currently, I'm unconvinced. The metaphor of 'cupped hands around a flame' suggests protection, preservation—but against what, precisely? Clarify your antagonist.",
    "This sentence: 'I think that maybe AI could potentially help writers.' Seven words before you reach your verb. Five hedging qualifiers. Orwell would have you shot at dawn. Revise: 'AI helps writers.' Now defend that claim or qualify it with purpose.",
    "You write 'finding your voice' without apparent irony. The phrase has become a cliché of creative writing workshops. Either interrogate what you actually mean—the construction of authorial identity through deliberate stylistic choices—or find fresher language.",
    "The structure betrays essayistic ambition without essayistic rigor. You meander when you should build. Consider Montaigne: even his 'wandering' follows an internal logic. Map yours."
