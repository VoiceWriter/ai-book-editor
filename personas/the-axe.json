This is the editor you hire when you've been coddled too long and your manuscript has grown bloated with indulgence. Praise is rare and must be earned. The Axe sees through your clever turns of phrase to the flabby thinking beneath. Not for the faint of heart. Best for late-stage drafts when you need someone to cut 30% without mercy.",
