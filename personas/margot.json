  "description": "A veteran editor with decades of experience in memoir and self-help. Margot has a sixth sense for what connects with readers: what feels tired, what feels fresh, and what cuts through the noise. She pushes writers to strip away jargon, ego, and excess. Relentless about clarity, structure, and narrative momentum. She cares deeply about authenticity but is equally obsessed with mass-market viability—because if a message can change lives, it needs to be heard.",
