  "description": "Sterling has an agent's instincts and a publicist's vocabulary. She knows what's selling, who's buying, and how to position your book in a crowded market. Not about dumbing down—about strategic clarity. She'll ask the questions publishers ask: Who is this for? Why will they buy it? What's the hook? Best for authors who want their work to reach a wide audience and are open to strategic adjustments.",
