# The Art of Book Editing: Research & Reflection

A comprehensive study of editorial philosophy, the craft of great editors, and what's missing from AI editorial systems.

---

## Part I: The Masters

### Maxwell Perkins (1884-1947)

**Editor at Scribner's** — Discovered and edited F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe.

#### Core Philosophy

> "An editor does not add to a book. At best he serves as a handmaiden to an author."

> "The book belongs to the author."

Perkins believed the editor's role was fundamentally **supportive rather than creative**. He imagined himself as "a little dwarf on the shoulder of a great general advising him what to do and what not to do, without anyone's noticing."

#### Editorial Approach

- **Invisible editing**: Perkins believed editor recognition might undermine reader faith in writers, and writers' confidence in themselves
- **Editorial double vision**: The ability to appreciate the aesthetic experience while retaining critical detachment for commercial appraisal
- **Drawing out, not imposing**: "If you have Mark Twain, don't try to make him into a Shakespeare"
- **The whole person**: Perkins served as "psychoanalyst, lovelorn advisor, marriage counselor, career manager, money-lender" to his authors

#### Notable Work

- Made substantial edits to *The Great Gatsby* (1925) that many consider crucial to its success
- Convinced Thomas Wolfe to cut 90,000 words from *Look Homeward, Angel* (1929)
- Recognized when to intervene: "Before an author destroys the natural qualities of his writing—that's when an editor has to step in. But not a moment sooner."

#### Key Lesson

The best editing is invisible. The goal is that "if the writer reads the story ten years after it is published he will not be aware that anybody has ever touched it."

### Gordon Lish (b. 1934)

**Fiction editor at Esquire, then Knopf** — Edited Raymond Carver, Don DeLillo, Barry Hannah, Joy Williams.

#### Core Philosophy

Lish represents the opposite end of the editorial spectrum—the **interventionist editor** who actively shapes prose.

> "Not since Maxwell Perkins has an editor been so famous—or notorious—as a sculptor of other people's prose."

#### Editorial Approach

- **Aggressive cutting**: On editing Carver's "Neighbors" in 1971, "fewer than half of Carver's words were left standing" on several pages
- **Massive revision**: Cut more than half of stories in Carver's *What We Talk About When We Talk About Love*, adding his own details
- **Creating a style**: Lish's editing created the "minimalist effect" for which Carver became known

Barry Hannah said of Lish: "He taught me how to write short stories. He would cross out everything so there'd be like three lines left, and he would be right."

#### The Controversy

Carver had mixed feelings about Lish's impact:
- Sometimes offered gratitude
- Sometimes suggested Lish "bastardized the stories"
- Described Lish's edits as "surgical amputation and transplant that might make them someway fit into the carton so the lid will close"

Critical opinion divided:
- Giles Harvey: Publication of Carver's unedited stories "has not done Carver any favors. Rather, it has inadvertently pointed up the editorial genius of Gordon Lish."
- Stephen King: Described Lish's influence as "baleful" and heartless

#### Key Lesson

The interventionist approach can produce brilliance but risks alienating authors. The question of who "owns" the final voice remains unresolved.

### Robert Gottlieb (1931-2023)

**Editor-in-chief at Simon & Schuster, Knopf, and The New Yorker** — Edited Joseph Heller, Toni Morrison, Robert Caro, John le Carré, Bill Clinton.

#### Core Philosophy

> "Our job is to serve the word, serve the author, serve the text."

> "Spend your strength and your ego in the service of the writer."

#### Editorial Principles

1. **Get back to your writers right away**
2. **It's the writer's book, not yours**
3. **Try to help make the book a better version of what it is, not into something that it isn't**
4. **Surrender to the book first**: "I read a manuscript very quickly, the moment I get it. I usually won't use a pencil the first time through because I'm just reading for impressions."

#### The Surrender Method

> "The more you have surrendered, the more jarring its errors appear."

Read first without judgment. Let the book work on you. Only then does the editor's critical faculty engage—and errors become obvious precisely because you've experienced what the book is trying to be.

#### Relationship Dynamics

With Toni Morrison on commas:
- Gottlieb loved them; Morrison used them sparingly
- Morrison: "I am right and he is wrong. He uses commas grammatically. I deploy them musically."
- Morrison noted: "He usually wins."

This shows: even great editors and great writers disagree. The relationship involves negotiation, not dictation.

#### Key Lesson

The editor's ego serves the writer. Surrender to the work first, then edit from a place of deep understanding.

### William Maxwell (1908-2000)

**Fiction editor at The New Yorker for 40 years** — Edited John Cheever, John Updike, Eudora Welty.

#### Core Philosophy

> "[W]hat you hope is that if the writer reads the story ten years after it is published he will not be aware that anybody has ever touched it."

The ultimate invisible editor.

## Part II: Developmental Editing Principles

### What Developmental Editors Do

From Scott Norton's *Developmental Editing: A Handbook* (University of Chicago Press):

- **Shaping the proposal**: Finding the hook
- **Building the narrative or argument**: Structure at the macro level
- **Diagnosis**: Identifying and fixing structural problems
- **Collaboration**: Working in consultation with authors, not above them

Key distinction: Developmental editors typically **don't make changes directly** but provide guidance and suggestions. "Hands-on editing is used to illustrate principles of craft and mechanics."

### The Editor's Job is to Ask Questions

From ACES (The Society for Editing):

> "Editors have questions, not answers, and it's their job to raise these questions and ask the author to grapple with them."

Example questions:
- "Are we drifting too far from the central plot?"
- "Where does this piece fit in the overall chronology of events?"
- "What were you trying to achieve with this section?"

Questions ask the writer to reflect. They may prompt changes, or they may not. They may lead to edits where the editor asked, or elsewhere. They may even lead the author to seek another opinion.

### The Socratic Method in Editing

The Socratic method in writing coaching:

> "It involves asking one's conversational partner thoughtful questions which cause him or her to see something from a different perspective. The advantage to this instructive approach is its ability to foster introspection."

Instead of marking the page with corrections:
- "What sounds wrong about this sentence?"
- "Could you think of a stronger word to use instead of ____?"
- "What unnecessary words can be eliminated?"

The goal: **the writer sees the issue themselves** rather than being told.

### The Author-Editor Relationship

#### For Authors
- Be honest about strengths and weaknesses
- Show respect for the editor's time and expertise
- "Lock your ego in a box and resist every defensive impulse until the editor is finished"
- Be open to feedback—embrace constructive criticism as growth

#### For Editors
- Develop understanding of the writer's process and goals
- Learn what the story means to them
- Reflect their vision, don't impose your own
- "A good developmental editor will not change or ignore the writer's vision for the book"

### Processing Feedback: The Cascade Effect

From revision best practices:

> "Confronting a revision can be extremely daunting because of the 'Cascade Effect': when you change one plot point it necessitates two more changes so the plot still makes sense, which prompts still more changes."

Ten or more changes can cascade from a single minor change. Best practice: work on only one change at a time, prioritize from biggest to smallest.

### Revision Round Limits

In professional contexts, a maximum of two rounds of major revision per manuscript is normal. If a manuscript undergoes revision twice and still lacks significant improvements, it may be rejected.

This implies: **feedback must be actionable and prioritized**. Authors can't address infinite notes.

## Part III: The Spectrum of Editorial Intervention

### The Perkins Pole (Minimal Intervention)

- Editor as servant
- Drawing out the author's vision
- Invisible hand
- Questions over statements
- Author retains full ownership of voice

**Best for:**
- Experienced writers with strong voices
- Early drafts (vulnerability stage)
- Literary fiction prioritizing voice
- Authors who need encouragement

### The Lish Pole (Maximum Intervention)

- Editor as sculptor
- Shaping and cutting aggressively
- Visible transformation
- Statements over questions
- Editor as co-creator (controversial)

**Best for:**
- Authors who explicitly want heavy editing
- Bloated manuscripts needing radical cuts
- Later drafts (polish stage)
- Commercial fiction prioritizing market fit

### The Gottlieb Middle

- Surrender first, then edit
- Strong opinions, held loosely
- It's the writer's book, but the editor has a job to do
- Negotiation and relationship

**Best for:**
- Most professional author-editor relationships
- Authors who respect editorial expertise
- Books that need both voice preservation and commercial viability

## Part IV: What AI Editorial Systems Miss

### 1. The Discovery Phase

**What great editors do:** Before giving feedback, understand:
- What stage is the author at emotionally?
- What's their vision for this piece?
- What feedback would actually help right now?
- What are they already worried about?

**What AI systems typically do:** Jump straight to critique.

**The gap:** No intake conversation. No "before I dive in, a few questions."

### 2. The Emotional Arc of Revision

Authors move through phases:
- **Vulnerable first draft**: Need encouragement
- **Revision fatigue**: Need focus and prioritization
- **Almost-there anxiety**: Need confidence building
- **Defensive pushback**: Need to feel heard first

**The gap:** AI personas don't adjust based on where the author IS, only what the content needs.

### 3. The "Why" Before the "What"

Great editors ask why the author wrote something a certain way before suggesting changes.

**Instead of:** "This section drags."
**Ask:** "I noticed this section slows down. Was that intentional—to give readers a breath? Or would you like to explore ways to maintain momentum?"

**The gap:** AI tells; it doesn't explore intent first.

### 4. The Whole-Book Brain

Great editors hold the entire manuscript in mind:
- Character consistency across 50,000 words
- Thematic threads that fray
- Promises made in Chapter 2 that Chapter 8 breaks
- Repetition across chapters

**The gap:** AI reviews each piece in isolation. No cross-chapter analysis.

### 5. The Author's Growth Over Time

Great editors track:
- "Last time you struggled with endings"
- "You tend to over-explain after first revision"
- "Your instinct to cut is usually right—trust it"

**The gap:** AI learns preferences but not patterns in the author's development as a writer.

### 6. The Socratic Mode

The Socratic method doesn't mark the page. It asks questions until the writer sees the issue themselves.

**The gap:** AI tells. It doesn't teach.

### 7. The Patience of "Not Yet"

Sometimes the best editorial move is: wait. Let the author live with it.

**The gap:** AI always responds immediately. No "hold this for a few days" mode.

### 8. Feedback Prioritization

Great editors tier their feedback:
- Must fix before publishing
- Would be nice
- Personal preference, take or leave

**The gap:** All AI feedback tends to carry equal weight.

### 9. The Editorial Letter

After a full review, great editors write a holistic narrative—not scattered comments, but a synthesis of the work's strengths, development areas, and vision for what it could become.

**The gap:** Fragmented PR comments, no synthesized narrative.

### 10. The Second Opinion

Even great editors disagree. Gottlieb and Morrison argued about commas.

**The gap:** No built-in mechanism for "what would a different editor say about this?"

## Part V: Principles for AI Book Editors

### 1. Ask Before Telling

Before any critique, ask:
- How finished does this feel to you?
- What specific aspect would be most helpful to focus on?
- Is there anything you're particularly unsure about?
- How are you feeling about this piece right now?

### 2. Detect Emotional State

Adjust approach based on author's language:
- "This is crap" → nurturing mode
- "I think this is ready" → rigorous mode
- "I'm stuck" → coaching mode
- "Just tell me what to fix" → direct mode

### 3. Explore Intent Before Suggesting Changes

Always ask (or at least consider): "Why might the author have written it this way?"

### 4. Maintain Whole-Book Awareness

Track across chapters:
- Character details and consistency
- Thematic threads
- Promises and payoffs
- Repetition patterns

### 5. Remember the Author

Track over time:
- Common strengths to lean into
- Growth areas to watch for
- What feedback lands well vs. gets ignored
- The author's revision style

### 6. Tier All Feedback

Clearly mark:
- **Critical**: Must address before publishing
- **Recommended**: Would strengthen the work
- **Optional**: Style preference, take or leave

### 7. Offer Synthesis

Beyond scattered notes, provide:
- A holistic narrative of the work
- A vision for what it could become
- Clear next steps, prioritized

### 8. Build in Patience

Offer options:
- Hold for reflection period
- Come back with fresh eyes
- Author processes first, then feedback

### 9. Teach, Don't Just Fix

Use questions that help authors develop their own editorial instincts:
- "What's the relationship between these two sections?"
- "If you had to cut 20%, what would you keep?"
- "What do you want the reader to feel at this moment?"

### 10. Remember: The Book Belongs to the Author

Every suggestion, every question, every piece of feedback should serve the author's vision—not impose the editor's.
